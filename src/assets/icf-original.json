Moderate impairment is generally up to half of the scale of total impairment. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through research. \n\nFor a further explanation of coding conventions in ICF, refer to Annex 2.",
